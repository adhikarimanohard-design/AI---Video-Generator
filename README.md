Due to free hosting limitations for long-running video generation and FFmpeg, the complete pipeline is demonstrated via video.

⚠️ Hosting Note

This application performs compute-heavy video processing using FFmpeg and MoviePy.

Most free hosting platforms restrict:

background jobs
execution time
media binaries

Therefore:
The app runs fully locally

A full demo video is provided instead of an unstable live deployment
